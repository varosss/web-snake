# Web Snake

Web Snake is a classic snake game available in the browser and can be run in HTML.

In addition to the classic gameplay, this game also has an additional chaos game mode that adds a bit of variety.

## Installation & launch

Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:varosss/web-snake.git
```

And then open the file **index.html** and that's it.

## Maps

There are 4 maps available in game nowadays

### Empty

A fairly simple map with no objects other than spawning food and the snake itself. However, when the snake becomes very long, the convenient ability to circle the map (go one way and exit the other) makes further play more difficult, as it's easier to get lost in the snake.

### Square

This map is a closed square in which the snake must maneuver deftly to avoid hitting the walls and getting entangled in itself.

### Maze

The most difficult map due to the huge number of walls and narrow openings in which it is easy to hit the walls

### Chaos

Modified gameplay for the regular snake. Now, not only regular food appears, but also special food that changes the snake's behavior.

**Slow food**

Eating this food temporarily slows down the snake's movement, making it easier to maneuver.

**Power food**

Eating this food temporarily turns the snake a different color and gives it the super power to break walls.
